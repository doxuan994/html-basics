                <h5 id="c-1-1">I. The Period</h5>
                <p title="Chapter I">
                    It was the best of times,
                    it was the worst of times,
                    it was the age of wisdom,
                    it was the age of foolishness,
                    it was the epoch of belief,
                    it was the epoch of incredulity,
                    it was the season of Light,
                    it was the season of Darkness,
                    it was the spring of hope,
                    it was the winter of despair,
                    we had everything before us,
                    we had nothing before us,
                    we were all going direct to <u>Heaven</u>,
                    we were all going direct the other way--
                    in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of
                    its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
                    evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

                    There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
                    <b>throne of England</b>; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
                    a fair face, on the <b>throne of France</b>. In both countries it was clearer
                    than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,
                    that things in general were settled for ever.

                    It was the year of <b>Our Lord</b> one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
                    Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,
                    as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
                    blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
                    heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
                    made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane
                    ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its
                    messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally
                    deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the
                    earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,
                    from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange
                    to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any
                    communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane
                    brood.

                    France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her
                    sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down
                    hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her
                    Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane
                    achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue
                    torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not
                    kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
                    which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty
                    yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and
                    Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,
                    already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into
                    boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in
                    it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses
                    of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were
                    sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with
                    rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which
                    the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of
                    the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work
                    unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about
                    with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
                    that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.

                    In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
                    justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
                    highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;
                    families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing
                    their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman
                    in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
                    challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
                    <i>“the Captain,”</i> gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the
                    mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and
                    then got shot dead himself by the other four, <i>“in consequence of the
                    failure of his ammunition:”</i> after which the mail was robbed in peace;
                    that magnificent potentate, the <b>Lord Mayor of London</b>, was made to stand
                    and deliver on <b>Turnham Green</b>, by one highwayman, who despoiled the
                    illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in <b>London</b>
                    gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law
                    fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;
                    thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at
                    Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search
                    for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the
                    musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences
                    much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy
                    and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing
                    up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on
                    Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the
                    hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of
                    <b>Westminster Hall</b>; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,
                    and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of
                    sixpence.

                    All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close
                    upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
                    Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,
                    those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the
                    fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights
                    with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred
                    and seventy-five conduct their <b>Greatnesses</b>, and myriads of small
                    creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the
                    roads that lay before them.
